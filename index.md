abstract: "We are a Sydney-based, community-driven initiative that takes a hands-on approach in doing cool security stuff: we're less about debating the merits of the latest iteration of the PCI-PTS or whether a particular vulnerability should have a CVSS score of 6.75 or 6.77, and more about bringing together like-minded people to share ideas, work on cool information security projects and participate in community events together. Think of it as a casual infosec fight club of sorts: the only real rule is that you have to play."

If you're interested in information security, and willing to spend time and effort actually contributing to cool security projects, whether it be through helping organise venues and content for events, by participating in community events like CTFs or even via code commits (especially via code commits!): let's talk (:

## PlatypusCon Conference

Ever since Ruxcon departed for Melbourne, the Sydney infosec community has been sorely missing a conference-style event to bring the community together for a few days of sharing ideas, showcasing our projects and drinking.

In the spirit of what brought this community together, we're aiming to build a more hands-on event: that is, instead of a series of talks while you plan on missing to catch up with your friends at the cafe down the road, we're putting together a series of labs (think lock-picking tables, SDR workshops, a CTF...) and "lightning (whisky) talk" style events where everyone who wants to participate can.

## Community Events

As a group, we frequent many of the community events around Sydney. You'll generally find us at events like:

- Platypus events
- Sectalks Sydney
- Ruxmon Sydney
- CryptoParty Sydney
- 2600 Sydney

Our regular [Platypus events] (http://www.meetup.com/en-AU/OWASP-Sydney-Web-Application-Security-Group/) gives us the opportunity to do tons of cool security shit like:

Workshops
: We get together to talk about new technology ideas, similar to a university-style "lab" session.

Radio on the Rooftop
: We get together and explore the wonderful world of software defined radio from the comfort of a rooftop bar.

Software Analysis and Vulnerability Discovery
: We share the joy of controlling $PC together.

Pick & Hack Locks
: We pick, dismantle, modify and perform forensics on locks both mechanical & digital.

CTF
: Competing, learning and failing in **Capture the Flag** competitions together, working as a team to strengthen our technical skills.

... and sooo much more.
