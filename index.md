abstract: "We are a Sydney-based, community-driven initiative that takes a hands-on approach in doing cool security stuff: we're less about debating the merits of the latest iteration of the PCI-PTS or whether a particular vulnerability should have a CVSS score of 6.75 or 6.77, and more about bringing together like-minded people to share ideas, work on cool information security projects and participate in community events together. Think of it as a casual infosec fight club of sorts: the only real rule is that you have to play."

If you're interested in information security, and willing to spend time and effort actually contributing to cool security projects, whether it be through helping organise venues and content for events, by participating in community events like CTFs or even via code commits (especially via code commits!): let's talk =]

### Workshops
Android Apps Penetration Testing (2.5hr)
: By David Jorm + Mike Gianarakis

  - Structure of Android applications 
  - Decompilation and source code analysis 
  - Sandbox and permissions model 
  - Data storage and associated vulnerabilities 
  - Logging 
  - Intercepting and analysing network communications 
  - A simple CTF challenge

: Attendee requirements: basic knowledge of Linux and Java is presumed. A laptop with appropriate tools installed beforehand is required

Badge Soldering (Whole Day - Come and Go @ Chillout Area)
: By idont
: idont: cyber-something

Blinkenlights (Friday Night - Come and Go @ Chillout Area)
: By andrew bolin
: DIY animated LED decorations, custom designed for the camp. Choose your colour from Green (for first time solderers), Yellow (second-timers?), or Red (if you like moving grains of rice with tweezers). Being a tech camp, of course there'll be an easter egg in the code =]
: Andrew learned to solder before learning to write and has been tinkering with electronics ever since, with hobbies include building psychedelic LED circuits and collecting Raspberry Pis. His day job is building embedded systems to keep lithium batteries happy.

Blue Team Jamming (2hr - Come and Go)
: By lin_s + nullwolf
: nulwolf: Penetration Tester and Security Researcher. Obsessions: Physical security, social engineering,  brewing beer, playing with fire, and software defined radio.

Drone Racing (3/4 Day - Come and Go @ Drone Village)

Locks Bypass 102 (1hr)
: By topy + klepas

Mouse - hijacking, arduinos and burning my hands - jack (1hr)
: By snail
: Sometimes you just get bored and want to mildly annoy random strangers by shaking their wireless mouse and typing "LOL HACKED!". The second part of with this workshop will then help you build your own with an Arduino (or burn your hand with solder, whichever is more fun) before you get bored and have a beer at the Chillout Area. 
: There is one official workshop on mousejack but the toys will be available all day for you to come and play with at the Chillout Area (with a beer)
: snail is slimy and slow

NFC tags, and why you shouldn’t put one in your hand (Whole Day - Come and Go @ Chillout Area)
: By Chris “THIS IS A FAKE NAME” Hansen
: If you’re actually interested in reasons not to put one in your hand, I’m the wrong person to ask. I got really drunk and convinced a stressed out family member to inject it into my hand at 2AM. This workshop will however cover things like “Don’t let @snail order NFC tags for you” and “Why can’t you use a proxmark on OS X?“. Drop in, drop out, drop a 0day. Or don’t. I’m a bio, not a cop.

SDR Foxhunting Funtimes Outside! (Whole Day - Come and Go @ SDR village)
: By pamoshea, nullwolf + faz
: This workshop forces you to take a walk and practice foxhunting for a number of signals around Platypus Camp.
: If you are new to SDR don't worry, come along with a laptop and we will have some bootable USBs and RTLSDR dongles you can borrow on the day.
: For wifi fun, please bring a can and an Alfa card.
: All other signals (excluding wifi) will be around 433Mhz, feel free to bring any directional antennae you have for this frequency. For example, a [tape measure antenna](http://www.instructables.com/id/433-MHz-tape-measure-antenna-suits-UHF-transmitte/)
: If you have any portable radios e.g. handheld Baofeng, bring these too as they can be handy for finding signals.
: If you have worked with SDR before, nullwolf has prepared a reverse engineering challenge for you. You may also want to team up with a lock picker for one of the challenges too!
: In summary, there should be a challenge for everyone - see you there!
: Pamela O'Shea (@pamoshea): Pamela is a pentester from Melbourne. She is an organiser of the Melbourne Software Defined Radio Group and follows the prime directive.
: nulwolf: Penetration Tester and Security Researcher. Obsessions: Physical security, social engineering,  brewing beer, playing with fire, and software defined radio.
: faz: Cybersecurity practice owner & lecturer who occasionally turns up to platypus events to just hack shit

: Attendee requirements: administrative access to a laptop with the ability to install tools, disable firewalls or virus scanners, and a player to run VirtualBox/VMWare images.
