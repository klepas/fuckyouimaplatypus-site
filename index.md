abstract: "We are a Sydney-based, community-driven initiative that takes a hands-on approach in doing cool security stuff: we're less about debating the merits of the latest iteration of the PCI-PTS or whether a particular vulnerability should have a CVSS score of 6.75 or 6.77, and more about bringing together like-minded people to share ideas, work on cool information security projects and participate in community events together. Think of it as a casual infosec fight club of sorts: the only real rule is that you have to play."

If you're interested in information security, and willing to spend time and effort actually contributing to cool security projects, whether it be through helping organise venues and content for events, by participating in community events like CTFs or even via code commits (especially via code commits!): let's talk =]

## PlatypusCon Conference

Ever since Ruxcon departed for Melbourne, the Sydney infosec community has been sorely missing a conference-style event to bring the community together for a few days of sharing ideas, showcasing our projects and horrendous alcoholism.

In the spirit of what brought this community together, weâ€™re aiming to build a super hands-on event: that is, instead of a series of talks while you plan on missing to catch up with your friends at the cafe down the road, we're putting together a full day of hands-on workshops where you can get your hands dirty and we can all help each other learn something new.
Bring your laptop (or phone or tablet or whatever) to get the most out of this event: infact, **bring something you can SSH on or don't come at all**.

Date
: Saturday 24th September 2016 (ink that in!)
: Doors open at 9:00am
: Official welcome at 9:30am
: Closing at 5:00pm

Cost
: $65 cash at the door (does not include t-shirt)
: $75 cash at the door (includes a sexy platypus t-shirt) - you can let us know your size in advance on [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }})
: $60 hoodies, limited numbers available on the day

Prerequisites
: Bring your laptop, no excuses
: Be prepared to play

Location
: aMBUSH Gallery -- Level 3, Central Park Mall, 28 Broadway Chippendale NSW 2008

A Game of Flags
: A twist on the traditional capture the flag wargames
: Capture flags for platypuscoins, spend them to upgrade your box or attack others
: Keep your eyes peeled, flags are everywhere
: Hosted by muld0r
: Prizes include platypus plushies, because fuck yes [tm]

The Art of Breaking (into stuff. buildings, lockers, whatever)
: Ever wanted to experiment with picking locks?
: Pick locks, push pins, pop handcuffs, also don't get in trouble
: Hosted by topy and klepas

Making Sh*t up with gdb
: Want to get those sweet, sweet reversing and exploitation flags in CTFs?
: Have your IDA Pro ready, but not sure where to stick it?
: Can't be bothered trawling through tons of disassembly and just want to know where to put your breakpoint?
: Hosted by lin_s

Lightning Talks
: Fight club style
: 5 minute limit
: With fireball shots - shot required for every additional minute you require
: Open mic

... and much **much** more (SDR, iOS / Android exploitation, Linux, hardware, lessons learned from CTFs etc)

Think of it like nerd fight club: it doesn't matter if you're new to this infosec thing, or you've been at it for ages: everyone's expected to participate, and you won't find it fun if you're expecting to just come and sit and listen to other people's work.

Sunset Launch Pre-party
: The green patch of grass **behind** the State Museum of Contemporary Art (overlooking the Harbour Bridge and Opera House)

After-Party
: Some dingy bar

Sunrise After-After-Party
: Some penthouse, which all are welcome to crash at

The-Morning-After-Brekky-BBQ
: Some hipster brekky bar

This first year is by us, for us: if you're a platypus and there's no more tickets (or if you're broke as shit, spent your last $4.50 on ramen but want to come anyway), ping lin_s / snail and we'll sort you out :)

## Community Events

As a group, we frequent many of the community events around Sydney. You'll generally find us at events like:

- Platypus events
- Sectalks Sydney
- Ruxmon Sydney
- CryptoParty Sydney
- 2600 Sydney

Our regular [Platypus events](http://www.meetup.com/en-AU/OWASP-Sydney-Web-Application-Security-Group/) gives us the opportunity to do tons of cool security shit like:

Workshops
: We get together to talk about new technology ideas, similar to a university-style "lab" session.

Radio on the Rooftop
: We get together and explore the wonderful world of software defined radio from the comfort of a rooftop bar.

Software Analysis and Vulnerability Discovery
: We share the joy of controlling $PC together.

Pick & Hack Locks
: We pick, dismantle, modify and perform forensics on locks both mechanical & digital.

CTF
: Competing, learning and failing in **Capture the Flag** competitions together, working as a team to strengthen our technical skills.

... and sooo much more.
