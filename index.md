abstract: "We are a Sydney-based, community-driven initiative that takes a hands-on approach in doing cool security stuff: we're less about debating the merits of the latest iteration of the PCI-PTS or whether a particular vulnerability should have a CVSS score of 6.75 or 6.77, and more about bringing together like-minded people to share ideas, work on cool information security projects and participate in community events together. Think of it as a casual infosec fight club of sorts: the only real rule is that you have to play."

If you're interested in information security, and willing to spend time and effort actually contributing to cool security projects, whether it be through helping organise venues and content for events, by participating in community events like CTFs or even via code commits (especially via code commits!): let's talk =]

As a group, we frequent many of the community events around Sydney. You'll generally find us at events like:

- Sectalks Sydney: every 3rd Tuesday of the month
- Ruxmon Sydney: every 3rd Friday of the month
- CryptoParty Sydney

Our semi-regular [Platypus events](http://www.meetup.com/en-AU/OWASP-Sydney-Web-Application-Security-Group/) gives us the opportunity to do tons of cool security shit like:

Workshops
: We get together to talk about new technology ideas, similar to a university-style "lab" session.

Software analysis and vulnerability discovery
: We share the joy of controlling $PC together.

Pick & hack locks
: We pick, dismantle, modify and perform forensics on locks both mechanical & digital.

CTF
: Competing, learning and failing in **Capture the Flag** competitions together, working as a team to strengthen our technical skills.

... and sooo much more.
