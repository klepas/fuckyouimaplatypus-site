abstract: "We are a Sydney-based, community-driven initiative that takes a hands-on approach in doing cool security stuff: we're less about debating the merits of the latest iteration of the PCI-PTS or whether a particular vulnerability should have a CVSS score of 6.75 or 6.77, and more about bringing together like-minded people to share ideas, work on cool information security projects and participate in community events together. Think of it as a casual information security fight club of sorts: the only real rule is that you have to play."

If you're interested in information security, and willing to spend time and effort actually contributing to cool security projects, whether it be through helping organise venues and content for events, by participating in community events like CTF's or even via code commits (especially via code commits!): let's talk :)

## Conference

Ever since Ruxcon departed for Melbourne, the Sydney information security community has been sorely missing a conference-style event to bring the community together for a few days of sharing ideas, showcasing our projects and drinking. We're working together to build such an event later this year.

In the spirit of what brought this community together, we're aiming to build a more hands-on event: that is, instead of a series of talks while you plan on missing to catch up with your friends at the cafe down the road, we're putting together a series of labs (think lock-picking tables, SDR workshops, a CTF...) and "lightning talk" style events where everyone who wants to participate can.

Date
: Saturday 24. September (ink that in!)

Location
: Gasoline Motor Co -- 88 Bourke Rd, Alexandria NSW 2015

After-party
: Fairground Follies -- 22 Burrows Rd, St Peters NSW 2044

## Community Events

As a group, we frequent many of the community events around Sydney. You'll generally find us at events like:

- Platypus events
- Sectalks Sydney
- Ruxmon Sydney
- CryptoParty Sydney
- 2600 Sydney

And of course, this just isn't enough hacking for us, so we regularly get together to do tons of fun shit like:

Workshops
: We get together to talk about new technology ideas, similar to a university-style "lab" session.

Radio on the Rooftop
: We get together and explore the wonderful world of software defined radio from the comfort of a rooftop bar.

Software analysis and vulnerability discovery
: We share the joy of controlling $PC together.

Pick & hack locks
: Tinkering, dismantling, modifying, and of course picking locks.

CFP
: Competing in internal Capture the Flag competitions together, working as a team to solve interesting security challenges.

... and a bunch more.
