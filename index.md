abstract: "We are a Sydney-based, community-driven initiative that takes a hands-on approach in doing cool security stuff: we're less about debating the merits of the latest iteration of the PCI-PTS or whether a particular vulnerability should have a CVSS score of 6.75 or 6.77, and more about bringing together like-minded people to share ideas, work on cool information security projects and participate in community events together. Think of it as a casual infosec fight club of sorts: the only real rule is that you have to play."

If you're interested in information security, and willing to spend time and effort actually contributing to cool security projects, whether it be through helping organise venues and content for events, by participating in community events like CTFs or even via code commits (especially via code commits!): let's talk =]

## PlatypusCon Conference

At long last, platypuscon is here... Ever since Ruxcon departed for Melbourne, the Sydney infosec community has been sorely missing a conference-style event to bring the community together for a few days of sharing ideas, showcasing our projects and horrendous alcoholism.

In the spirit of what brought this community together, we're aiming to build a super hands-on event: that is, instead of a series of talks while you plan on missing to catch up with your friends at the cafe down the road, we're putting together a full day of hands-on workshops where you can get your hands dirty and we can all help each other learn something new.
Bring your laptop (or phone or tablet or whatever) to get the most out of this event: infact, **bring something you can SSH on or don't come at all**.

Date
: Saturday 24th September 2016 (ink that in!)
: Doors open at 9:00am
: Official welcome at 9:45am
: Closing at 6:30pm

Cost
: Book tickets [online](https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/platypuscon-teh-platypus-partay-tickets-26222957572">https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/platypuscon-teh-platypus-partay-tickets-26222957572)
: Limited tickets available at the door, $75 cash (includes a sexy platypus t-shirt)
: $60 hoodies, limited numbers available on the day
: Let us know your size in advance to avoid disappointment [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }})
: This is an 18+ event. If you're still super keen to come, enquire within and we'll work something out

Prerequisites
: Bring your laptop, no excuses
: Think of it like a nerd fight club: it doesn't matter if you're new to this infosec thing, or you've been at it for ages; everyone's expected to participate, and you won't find it fun if you're expecting to just come and sit and listen to other people's work.

Location
: aMBUSH Gallery -- Level 3, Central Park Mall, 28 Broadway Chippendale NSW 2008

Instead of the usual conference fare of 2 tracks of talks over two days, we're going with a workshop-only format. Drop in and drop out as you please. Each session is intended to be practical in nature instead of someone standing up the front and talking at people. This year, we've lined up a full day of content, with some never-before-seen content, including:

: Drone Hacking for Beginners
	: Ever wanted to walk out of a workshop with a viable skill set and practical knowledge, ready to impress the government your friends and family? You will be leaving this session with the skills to hack a very popular consumer drone; and the methodologies to attack and defend others like it. You may even open yourself up to future employment as a 'Drone Security Engineer'
	: We will be guiding participants through different attack levels; from live camera feed interception, to file system access, and real-time hijacking of controls
	: A final competition will be held to challenge attackers to gain control of a drone, and defend their access from other players

: Fuzzing with Rabbits for Fun and Profit
	: Fuzzing is the art of applying random data in the hopes of finding inputs to programs that cause unexpected behaviors 
	: Traditionally, this has taken a deterministic approach which is akin to something to do with monkeys, typewriters, and Shakespeare
	: Enter american fuzzy lop (afl), not just a weird looking bunny [1], but actually a new generation fuzzer from Google that takes into account code coverage
	: This workshop will give a brief overview of afl-fuzz, show off its features, and gives an example of things Hugh has found, and how much bounty has been made. Comparisons to other fuzzers will be made

	: Highlights from the workshop include: Active and Passive Reconnaissance; Vulnerability Discovery; Vulnerability Confirmation; Vulnerability Analysis; Establishing a foothold; Privilege Escalation; Lateral Movement; and Domain Compromise
	: Hosted by Lukasz (SyNick)
	: Lukasz is a managing consultant with Alcorn Group, a Brisbane based security consultancy firm
: Hardware Magic
	: Hosted by Silvio	
: iOS Funstuff
  : This workshop will cover some of the in's and out's of attacking iOS apps and specifically reverse engineering and bypassing anti-tampering and other protection mechanisms commonly deployed by developers
  : From there (if we have time) we will apply these techniques to common libraries/frameworks and various userland processes for some more fun and profit.
  : NOTE: To get the most out of this workshop a jailbroken device running at least iOS 7 would be ideal. There will be a few spare ones around but will be handed out on a first come first serve basis. If you miss out or don't have one don't stress, all the binaries will be handed out and you can follow on with anything not on the device.

## Community Events

As a group, we frequent many of the community events around Sydney. You'll generally find us at events like:

- Sectalks Sydney: every 3rd Tuesday of the month
- Ruxmon Sydney: every 3rd Friday of the month
- CryptoParty Sydney
- 2600 Sydney: every 1st Friday of the month

Our semi-regular [Platypus events](http://www.meetup.com/en-AU/OWASP-Sydney-Web-Application-Security-Group/) gives us the opportunity to do tons of cool security shit like:

Workshops
: We get together to talk about new technology ideas, similar to a university-style "lab" session.

Radio on the Rooftop
: We get together and explore the wonderful world of software defined radio from the comfort of a rooftop bar.

Software Analysis and Vulnerability Discovery
: We share the joy of controlling $PC together.

Pick & Hack Locks
: We pick, dismantle, modify and perform forensics on locks both mechanical & digital.

CTF
: Competing, learning and failing in **Capture the Flag** competitions together, working as a team to strengthen our technical skills.

... and sooo much more.
