title: FIN.
abstract: "The platypus is dead, and has been for a while. What started out as a community of like-minded peers, working together on growing ourselves technically, it has turned into something that we promised we would never be - just another infosec community, championing participation instead of excellence, welcoming everyone while forgetting what it means to be part of 'us'.

Let this remain, as a reminder of what we once were."
