abstract: "We are a Sydney-based, community-driven initiative that takes a hands-on approach in doing cool security stuff: we're less about debating the merits of the latest iteration of the PCI-PTS or whether a particular vulnerability should have a CVSS score of 6.75 or 6.77, and more about bringing together like-minded people to share ideas, work on cool information security projects and participate in community events together. Think of it as a casual infosec fight club of sorts: the only real rule is that you have to play."

If you're interested in information security, and willing to spend time and effort actually contributing to cool security projects, whether it be through helping organise venues and content for events, by participating in community events like CTFs or even via code commits (especially via code commits!): let's talk =]

## PlatypusCon Conference

Ever since Ruxcon departed for Melbourne, the Sydney infosec community has been sorely missing a conference-style event to bring the community together for a few days of sharing ideas, showcasing our projects and horrendous alcoholism.

In the spirit of what brought this community together, we're aiming to build a super hands-on event: that is, instead of a series of talks while you plan on missing to catch up with your friends at the cafe down the road, we're putting together a full day of hands-on workshops where you can get your hands dirty and we can all help each other learn something new.
Bring your laptop (or phone or tablet or whatever) to get the most out of this event: infact, **bring something you can SSH on or don't come at all**.

Date
: Saturday 24th September 2016 (ink that in!)
: Doors open at 9:00am
: Official welcome at 9:45am
: Closing at 6:30pm

Cost
: Book tickets [online](https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/platypuscon-teh-platypus-partay-tickets-26222957572">https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/platypuscon-teh-platypus-partay-tickets-26222957572)
: Limited tickets available at the door, $75 cash (includes a sexy platypus t-shirt)
: $60 hoodies, limited numbers available on the day
: Let us know your size in advance to avoid disappointment [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }})
: This is an 18+ event. If you're still super keen to come, enquire within and we'll work something out

Prerequisites
: Bring your laptop, no excuses
: Think of it like a nerd fight club: it doesn't matter if you're new to this infosec thing, or you've been at it for ages; everyone's expected to participate, and you won't find it fun if you're expecting to just come and sit and listen to other people's work.

Location
: aMBUSH Gallery -- Level 3, Central Park Mall, 28 Broadway Chippendale NSW 2008

Instead of the usual conference fare of 2 tracks of talks over two days, we're going with a workshop-only format. Drop in and drop out as you please. Each session is intended to be practical in nature instead of someone standing up the front and talking at people. This year, we've lined up a full day of content, with some never-before-seen content, including:

Workshops
: Antennae for every Occassion
: Attacking Firmware Binaries
: Bug Bounties
: Ding dong. Who's there? EVERYONE
: Drone Hacking
: Fuzzing with Rabbits for Fun and Profit
: iOS Funstuff
: IR Spoofing to Unlock Alarms
: Making sh*t up with GDB

  - Hosted by lin_s</dd>

The Art of Breaking (into stuff. buildings, lockers, whatever)
: Ever wanted to experiment with picking locks?

: Hosted by topy and klepas

Fireball Talks
: Open mic 5 min lightning rants
: Shot required for every additional minute required

After-Party
: Some dingy bar

This first year is by us, for us: if you're a platypus and there's no more tickets (or if you're broke as shit, spent your last $4.50 on ramen but want to come anyway), ping lin_s / snail and we'll sort you out :)

## Community Events

As a group, we frequent many of the community events around Sydney. You'll generally find us at events like:

- Sectalks Sydney: every 3rd Tuesday of the month
- Ruxmon Sydney: every 3rd Friday of the month
- CryptoParty Sydney
- 2600 Sydney: every 1st Friday of the month

Our semi-regular [Platypus events](http://www.meetup.com/en-AU/OWASP-Sydney-Web-Application-Security-Group/) gives us the opportunity to do tons of cool security shit like:

Workshops
: We get together to talk about new technology ideas, similar to a university-style "lab" session.

Radio on the Rooftop
: We get together and explore the wonderful world of software defined radio from the comfort of a rooftop bar.

Software Analysis and Vulnerability Discovery
: We share the joy of controlling $PC together.

Pick & Hack Locks
: We pick, dismantle, modify and perform forensics on locks both mechanical & digital.

CTF
: Competing, learning and failing in **Capture the Flag** competitions together, working as a team to strengthen our technical skills.

... and sooo much more.
